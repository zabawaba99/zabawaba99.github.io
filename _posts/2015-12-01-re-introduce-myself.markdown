You can find about more about me in the <a href="about/">about me</a> section
(when I actually flesh it out) but in the meantime...

My name is Steven Berlanga. I enjoy programming, playing some music and breakfast food.

After some time, I finally got around to polishing up my site and writing a
couple of blogs after a **huge** overhaul in the design of the site by a good
friend of mine, [Carlos Corvaia](https://github.com/znja). The intention behind these
blogs are to share anything that I have learned during the struggle of programming.
There will probably also be some nontechnical blogs that slide on by as well.

If you would like to know more about me you can find me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zabawaba) and/or [GitHub](https://github.com/zabawaba99)
